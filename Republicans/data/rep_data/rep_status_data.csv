Sen. Susan Collins,"I enjoyed marching in this year’s 4th of July Parade in Lubec. Despite the harm caused by the current public health and economic crisis, Mainers are resilient. It was truly heartwarming to join the community in celebrating our great nation. https://t.co/GT85gJkXM1",2020-07-04 14:27:33.602552
Ted Cruz,"Beautiful. Watch &amp; listen. 

On this 4th of July, thank a soldier, hug a veteran, embrace a police officer, and thank God that He’s so greatly blessed the USA.
